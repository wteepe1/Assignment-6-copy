# Assignment 6 - Translating DNA to Amino Acids

Frequently, researchers need to translate a DNA sequence into the amino acids for which that sequence codes.
Write a python script that (1) asks the user how many DNA sequences they want to translate, (2) reads those
sequences, and (3) prints the corresponding amino acid sequence for each. Print a warning if the sequence 
contains a stop codon or if the length of the sequence is not a multiple of 3 (i.e., the sequence is incomplete).

Remember that protein-coding DNA sequences contain triplets of nucleotides called codons. Each codon (set of 
3 nucleotides) corresponds to an amino acid. For this assignment, use the standard genetic code to translate 
between codons and amino acids: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables#Standard_DNA_codon_table

As always, please leave clear comments in your script!

Hint: you will likely want to use a dictionary to help with this translation.
